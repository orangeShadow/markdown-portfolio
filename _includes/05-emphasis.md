### __SKILLS__

- **PHP** 7 years expirience and my favorite tool is Laravel, in most cases i use it in any project.

- **JavaScript** I use vanila js with databinding framework Vue.js

- **MYSQL** I  wrote hard queries like a KPI with twenty or more tables in one queries, but it was a long time ago, now i use Eloquent in 9 from 10 times

- **POSTGRESQL** Wrote hard queries too and write function on PGSQL but it was a lot years ago, may be now I need some practice, because my head get a lot of information every day and my brains work like stack, if you want to find first record you must proccessed all of them.

- **mongodb** - I use this database on work with e-commerce catalog, because every product has  unique count and values of properties and it is quite useful to introduce they like a document. I studied two cources on mongodby academy and got two certificates: [M101P MongoDB for Developers](https://university.mongodb.com/course_completion/2a32ff33808a4daf8dd26d0be16f0e6d), [M201: MongoDB Performance](https://university.mongodb.com/course_completion/2a32ff33808a4daf8dd26d0be16f0e6d)

- **nodejs** I have some experience broadcasting message from Laravel through socket.io library to client. I studied node js courses on site Udemy, but i didn't write any production  application.

May be here I need write about my theory skills but I am like a young student read and forget, if this knowledges  does not need me in this moment. __Because I am only human after all...__

And little bit about my hobby: I like play football and make a tourist trip
